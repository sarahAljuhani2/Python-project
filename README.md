About the data:
This is a sales transaction data set of UK-based e-commerce (online retail) for one year. This London-based shop has been selling gifts and homewares for adults and children through the website since 2007. Their customers come from all over the world and usually make direct purchases for themselves. There are also small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through retail outlet channels.

The data set contains 500K rows and 8 columns. The following is the description of each column.

1) TransactionNo (categorical): a six-digit unique number that defines each transaction. (The letter “C” in the code indicates a cancellation).

2) Date (numeric): the date when each transaction was generated.

3) ProductNo (categorical): a five or six-digit unique character used to identify a specific product.

4) Product (categorical): product/item name.

5) Price (numeric): the price of each product per unit in pound sterling (£).

6) Quantity (numeric): the quantity of each product per transaction. (Negative values indicate cancelled transactions).

7) CustomerNo (categorical): a five-digit unique number that defines each customer.

8) Country (categorical): name of the country where the customer resides.

There is a small percentage of order cancellation in the data set. Most of these cancellations were due to out-of-stock conditions on some products. Under this situation, customers tend to cancel an order as they want all products delivered all at once.
